        <p>This is an incredibly simple proof of concept for P2P video streaming. 
            This current version supports joining rooms of up to two people each, 
            chatting in those rooms, and video calling in those rooms, all in a 
            P2P manner. A central server is present in order to enable signaling 
            for the establishment of a WebRTC connection. In addition, it is 
            present to act as a TURN server if clients are behind symmetric NAT.
            Rooms are deleted once both members leave. </p>
